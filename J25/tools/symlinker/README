Nooku Symlinker
---------------

Make symlinks for Joomla extensions. This very useful to separate your Joomla 
installation from your extension project, but connect them using symlinks. That 
way you don't have to copy changes back and forth.

Works on *nix, OSX. For Windows Vista+, see README_win


Installation:

Put the symlinker bash script somewhere in your operating system's include path. 

Usage:

  symlinker <SOURCE> <TARGET>

Arguments:
  SOURCE  The source dir (usually from an IDE workspace containing the extension)
  TARGET  the target dir (usually where a Joomla installation resides)
